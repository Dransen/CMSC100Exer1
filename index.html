		<p>My favorite CMSC subject so far is CMSC 150 because I enjoyed making the project.</p><br>
		<p> My favorite GE on the other hand is Ethics because it is fun to see different world views/perpectives.  </p><br>
		<p>My favorite PL is Java. I just like the way how OOP works.</p><br>
		<p>I like lumpiang shanghai a lot. Star ng Pasko!</p>
